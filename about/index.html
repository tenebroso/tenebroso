<p class="lead"><strong>Tenebroso</strong> is the work of Jon Bukiewicz, a WordPress Customization Expert &amp; Designer from Chicago with over 18 years of experience.</p>
<h4>Website Design since 1996.</h4>
<p>How did I get started making websites? Since sitting down with my Dad to learn some of the basics as a kid back in 1996, my interest in web design has continually grown and expanded. I began in the days of non-transparent .gifs and Netscape Navigator (Geocities, anyone?) by working on official websites for nationally known bands including <a title="Not my finest hour." href="http://web.archive.org/web/19970404142502/http://www.jesusfreak.com/insyderz/?iframe=true&amp;width=60%&amp;height=60%" rel="prettyPhoto[iframes]">The Insyderz</a>, Squad Five-O and Johnny Respect. From there, I maintained a growing interest in web design through blogging both as a photographer and a writer while in high school. This led to an exploration of content management &amp; blogging systems like Blogger &amp; WordPress, visual enhancement &amp; usability through jQuery, and valid HTML, XHTML &amp; CSS through such talented trailblazers as the folks behind A List Apart, CSS Tricks and many others.</p>
<p>It is my hands-on experience combined with an ability to quickly adapt to new web technologies that has kept my interest in web design sharp. Currently I hold a position as the primary Midwest Regional Web Developer for an international Non-Profit Organization. It is here that I have further advanced in my working knowledge of Adobe Photoshop, Fireworks, Illustrator, XHTML &amp; HTML5 coding, jQuery, CSS2.1 &amp; CSS3, Server Optimization &amp; more. <strong>Tenebroso Web &amp; Graphic</strong> design fuels my desire to also keep sharp on WordPress, PHP and customized media development.</p>
<h4>WordPress Customization is my Bread &amp; Butter</h4>
<p>I live in Chicago with my wife and our two wonderful kids. We try to inspire positive change around us, where we are, by making environmentally and socially creative choices with our resources and time. This has led to a shared interest in biking, composting, gardening, organic cooking, community and simple living. My wife and I often spend our evenings listening to Bonnie Prince Billy, Jose Gonzalez or True Widow (look ‘em up – great stuff), though occassionally we’ll make an effort to spot the latest episode of Breaking Bad when we can.</p>
<h4>Are you available for my custom website project?</h4>
<p>Yes and I would be happy to help. As a freelancer, I am available and willing to help with all types of creative projects – from web and graphic design and development to WordPress help to photography and consulting. My experience as a web content designer and developer has led to an expertise in online mass communication.</p>
<h4>What would you charge for website coding and/or design?</h4>
<p>Pricing is usually dependent on the scope and needs of each individual project. Fortunately, I’m not required to pad the cost in order to cover typical full-time business expenses, so this enables me to competitively quote on each project. If you’re looking for a quote, or just have a question, shoot over some details about what you’d like to do. Most of the time I can get back to you within about 12 hours with a project quote or additional information.</p>
